The Misinformation Game is a social-media simulator built to study how people
interact with information on social-media. To achieve this, The Misinformation
Game simulates a social-media feed for research participants. Participants are
shown fake social-media posts, either one at a time or in a feed format. They
may then react to the posts and their comments. The Misinformation Game has
been designed to be highly customisable so that a range of tightly controlled
experiences can be created for participants. This customisability is a core
focus of The Misinformation Game, to facilitate the research of a wide array
of social-media related questions.
