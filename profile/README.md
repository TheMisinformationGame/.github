# The Misinformation Game

The Misinformation Game is a social media simulator built to study peopleâ€™s behaviour when they interact with social media. To achieve this, The Misinformation Game simulates a social media feed for research participants. Participants will be shown one fake social media post at a time, and they may then react to the post and its comments. The Misinformation Game has been designed to be highly customisable so that tightly controlled experiences can be created for participants. This customisability is a core focus of The Misinformation Game, to facilitate the research of a wide array of social media related questions.
